CHUGALUG Meeting Notes 2016-05-04

Meeting topic:  Plan for LinuxFest to be held on 6 July.

7 persons in attendance

First sub-topic:  What to do during the fest

* No formal presentations because this is too much to organize for our first try.

* Instead, have topical videos play in the background throughout the meeting.  
   ** Suggested topics:  
        *** Origins/History of LinuxFest
		*** Where all Linux is used (internet, phones, etc.)
		*** The distinction between GNU and Linux and the importance of both
   ** Did we have volunteers?  Maybe Austin, Kofi, Chris?  Jon? James?  

* Kofi will bring back swag from the SELF meeting (SouthEast LinuxFest) and display it 
  for attendees to check out.
		
* Refreshments will be provided by CHUGALUG/FRITA folks on a pot-luck/volunteer basis.
		
* From 6-7 PM, the installations of various distros will be demonstrated, particularly 
  difficult ones (Slackware, Arch, Gentoo), and people can later try those distros out.
  
* We have had one table offer from OpenSuse, which was well received.  This seems 
  generally desirable, and we will make a general call for table displays. Due to space 
  limitations, the maximum size should be a card table, and smaller is recommended.  
  
* We will encourage people to bring in distros of interest.  We will help install on the
  attendee's computer if desired.  If not, and if a FRITA computer is available, we will
  install it there so the person can try it out.
  
* We will make a general call for other ideas from the community.

Second sub-topic:  Where/how to advertize 

* We will make a 4-up flyer to be handed out freely at FRITA.  Chris and/or Miles and/or 
  Lachele will produce these.

* Distribute flyers to local computer businesses (GC Computer, Best Buy, etc.).  Chris 
  volunteered to lead this.

* Attend relevant MeetUps and hand out flyers.  Austin volunteered to lead this.

* Definitely make it known at FourAthens.  Kofi volunteered to lead this.

* Post notices in relevant online forums.

* All local calendars should be notified (Flagpole, UGA Master, Frita, FourAthens, 
  Libraries, Athens Tech, etc.)

* Attempts should be made to find appropriate contacts at various schools/libraries/etc.,
  for email notices.  James (? yes?) volunteered to help with that.
  ** In general, try to find local contacts.
  
* Try submitting PSAs to WUOG and WUGA.

* Take posters/flyers wherever reasonable (Tate Center, RoundSphere, FourAthens, etc.)

* In any event, flyers should be made soon.

Third sub-topic: Content of posters/flyers

* There will be two styles:
  ** One, a simple flyer with minimal info designed to catch the eye of passers by.
  ** Two, a flyer with more detail to be handed out in appropriate venues (e.g., at Frita).
  
* Contents of the simple poster/flyer:
  ** Day, time, location, what
  ** Try out Linux
  ** Learn to install Linux
  ** Get help using Linux
  ** Learn about linux
  
* The more detailed flyer will contain the above plus:
  ** Bring your own install media or try one provided
  ** Refreshments 
  ** Machines w/ several distros set up and ready to try
  ** First hour will be demonstrations of Linux being installed
  ** [my notes say "make obvious that other stuff happens, too", but I don't recall what
     that means]
  ** Learn where Linux is used
  ** Learn how to install
  ** Learn about Linux's history
  ** Purchase computers with Linux installed from Frita
  ** Interact with reps from Distros 
     *** We have one so far from OpenSuse - get blurb wording from him, possibly WRT the
	     OpenSuse efforts to simplify making a new distro
		 
Fourth sub-topic: Relevant administrative tasks

* Be sure to notify all mailing lists about all this

* Make online sign-up list/form/sheet (Chris volunteered)

* Make online agenda doc/sheet (Chris volunteered)

* Should we install RedStar?

* Ask the list for ideas

* Make more of the generic 4-up CHUGALUG flyers
