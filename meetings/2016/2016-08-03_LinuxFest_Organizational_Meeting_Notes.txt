CHUGALUG Meeting Notes from 2016-08-03
BLFoley

Topic:  Planning for a LinuxFest to be held on the UGA campus this Fall

First choice location:  Connector between the Science Library and Boyd.
  -- Miles will check around UGA to figure out who we need to ask for
     permission.  Then, he will go ask for permission.  He will also see
     if there are any staging areas where we can stash the computers and
     such the night before.

Date:  Currently thinking of Weds, 5 Oct.
Time:  Currently thining 10 AM to 4:30 PM

Publicity:  Miles will make flyers.  We will make sure that the 
     engineering folks know about it, also the usual FB/Twitter/etc.

What we plan to do:

  Have a little row of 3-5 computers set up for people to try out.
    -- Each computer has a theme, such as:
          * Easy for new users
          * Highly customizable
          * Harder to set up
          * Weird
          * Special Purpose
    -- Each computer will have several distros installed in VMs.
       Through the day, we will cycle different VMs on each machine.
       One will be full-screen (so not to confuse the users), and the
       others will be paused (so not to tax system resources).
    -- Have a BYOD space set up where we can help folks install the
       OS of their choice (or any that will install, etc.).
    -- Bring Caprica and set up a cloning station.
    -- Have a stack of live CDs from different distros to give out
       and let people try.  Lachele will look for a cheap source of
       dvd drives and small (1 GB is plenty) USB sticks (because many
       machines no longer have cd/dvd drives).  Have some CD's, too,
       for folks who bring really old machines.
    -- Have a table where students can talk to people from local 
       businesses that use Linux.  Kofi and Chris will help find
       people.  Kofi will focus on 4-Athens.  Chris will try others.
       Lachele will see if Chuck can make it on a weekday to plug
       Open Suse.  Google was mentioned, and maybe one of us (Chris?)
       can try to find out how to invite them.  We worry we'd be too
       small to be of interest.
    -- Have a machine set up where people can learn about using 
       VirtualBox to try out or use other distros.
