These notes are not in chronological order.

0.  Things overdue

-- Upload general and website files to GitHub


1.  Things that might help CHUGALUG in general

-- Ask if local teachers will give extra credit to students for 
    attending CHUGALUG meetings.

-- Make general fliers, 8.5x11 and 4-up.  Deliver these to FRITA, local
    computer repair shops, tech stores, schools, etc.

-- Is there still a "Computer Science Fraternity"?

-- Active members reach out to personal contacts.

-- Be sure to get annoucements onto email lists.  It was noted that the
    FRITA mail list has been dormant but might not always be.

-- Make press releases and distribute to Flagpole, Red&Black, Athens
    Banner-Herald and similar places.

-- Search for useful social media managers.

-- Develop a list of good contacts in the various departments at UGA
    and at other nearby schools and colleges.  (That is, try to find
    people who will know what CHUGALUG is and how to contact locals 
    who might be interested.)

-- Man tables occasionally at Tate.


2.  Regarding the InstallFest

-- Installing is no longer difficult.  Rename to "LinuxFest" and have
    these properties:

        * Add GNU/Linux near top, e.g., have a subtitle/tag-line that says:
         "Come learn about and celebrate GNU/Linux!"

        * Offer these three services:
                o Install Linux on computer
                    -- can buy one at FRITA for $15!
                o Try out Linux on computers set up in room
                o Get help with an existing install of Linux

-- Have pot-luck-style refreshments because we have no money and because that
    will require less planning and we have enough to do.

-- Have one, aimed at locals, on the first Weds in July at Free IT Athens
    This will span both FRITA and CHUG hours, from 6-9:30 PM.

-- Have a second one, aimed at UGA students, on campus, during the fall, on a
    day, time and place TBD.  The connector between the Science Library and Boyd
    was suggested.  The Tate Center is another option.  Free IT Athens is warmly
    welcome to participate in whatever capacity they wish, including bringing 
    computers along for sale.

-- Will the folks at FRITA want to restrict installation of media brought in 
    by an attendee onto a computer owned by the attendee?


3.  Other

-- The presence of alcoholic beverages at FRITA has precedent, but it would be 
    too much to worry with that during LinuxFest.  If individual members are
    so moved, they may bring what they wish to the meetings.
